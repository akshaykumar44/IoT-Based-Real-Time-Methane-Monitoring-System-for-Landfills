# IoT Based Real-Time Methane Monitoring System for Landfills
A project that demonstrates a low-cost, IoT based environmental monitoring system along with ThingSpeak data visualisation platform.

## Overview

This system is built to address the growing concern of gas accumulation in landfill sites, which can pose serious health and environmental hazards. Using a combination of calibrated gas sensors ‚Äî MQ-4 for methane, MQ-135 for carbon dioxide and other harmful gases, and DHT11 for temperature and humidity ‚Äî the system captures real-time data and transmits it to the cloud via Wi-Fi.
The data is visualized on **ThingSpeak**, allowing continuous monitoring and analysis. An **OLED display** provides instant local readings, while a web interface issues **smart alerts** to nearby personnel, improving safety and decision-making. Future extensions include scaling the system for wide-area coverage and exploring methane decomposition techniques for energy recovery.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks methane (CH‚ÇÑ), carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), temperature, and humidity in landfill environments.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Uploads sensor data to ThingSpeak for live graphing and analytics.
- **OLED Display**: Displays gas concentration locally for on-site monitoring.
- **Smart Alerts**: Sends web-based notifications when critical levels are detected.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Aims to convert harmful methane into safe compounds or useful energy in future phases.
