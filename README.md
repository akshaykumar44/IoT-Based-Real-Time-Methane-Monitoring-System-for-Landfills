# IoT-Based-Real-Time-Methane-Monitoring-System-for-Landfills
An IoT-based landfill gas monitoring system using MQ-4, MQ-135, and DHT11 sensors to detect CH₄, CO₂, temperature, and humidity. Real-time data is visualized on ThingSpeak and displayed on an OLED. Smart alerts via web interface ensure safety. Future work includes scaling and methane-to-energy conversion.
